# DATABASE NORMALIZATION 
## What is database normalization: 

Database normalization is a process used for data modeling or database creation where you organize your data and tables so they can be added and updated efficiently.

## Why is database normalization important: 
Normalization plays a crucial role in database design. Here are several reasons why itâ€™s essential:

* Reduces redundancy: Redundancy is when the same information is stored multiple times, and a good way of avoiding this   is by splitting data into smaller tables.
* Improves query performance: You can perform faster query execution on smaller tables that have undergone normalization.
* Minimizes update anomalies: With normalized tables, you can easily update data without affecting other records.
* Enhances data integrity: It ensures that data remains consistent and accurate.
